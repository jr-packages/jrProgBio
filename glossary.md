# Glossary of Terms

A glossary of biological terms in these practicals intended for the instructor. Also feel free to email queries to roman@jumpingrivers.com.

Term: **codon**

Definition: A codon is a combination of three DNA bases (GTAC). Codons form the basis of the genetic code, for example most codons code for an amino acid in the resulting proteins/peptides.

Term: **5' to 3'**

Definition: DNA strands/sequences have an orientation, in the same way that books are read from left to right DNA (or rather mRNA) is 'read' or translated from the 5' to the 3' end of the sequence. This ensures that the same codons are used each time.
